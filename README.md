## Goals

- Display Video in Player 360
- Show annotations

## Setup

- `npm install` to deploy dependencies
- prepare  `static` directories for local content (dev mode):
- `static/jobs`
- `static/jobs/[job-id]` in sample files received `job-id` is [63025](static/jobs/63025)
- `static/jobs/[job-id]/json` should contain [metadata.json](static/jobs/63025/json/metadata.json) file, as
- `static/jobs/[job-id]/frames` should contain snapshot files list named accordingly as mentioned
  in [metadata.json](static/jobs/63025/json/metadata.json)
- `static/jobs/[job-id]/stitched` should contain [video.mp4](static/jobs/63025/stitched/video.mp4) prepared to be used
  in Player 360

So it should became like:

- `static/jobs/[job-id]/json/metadata.json`
- `static/jobs/[job-id]/frames/[files**]`
- `static/jobs/[job-id]/stitched/video.mp4`

## Run

After Setup is finished, you can either start the app in dev mode

- `npm run dev`

Or prepare dist bundle and preview prod mode

- `npm run build` - build for production
- `npm run preview` - locally preview production build

## Scripts

- `dev`/`start` - start dev server and open browser
- `build` - build for production
- `preview` - locally preview production build
